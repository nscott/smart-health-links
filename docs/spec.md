# SHL Protocol Specification

#### Actors

* **Data Sharer**. Person who decides to share health data
* **Data Recipient**. Person or organization responsible for receiving health data


## 1. Data Sharer Configures a new SHLink

The Data Sharer makes a few decisions at configuration time:

* **What to share**. Depending on the Data Sharer's software, this could be an explicit set of files or a "sharing policy" that matches different data over time.
* **Whether the SHLink will require a Passcode** to access. Depending on the Data Sharer's software, a Passcode may be mandatory.
* **Whether the SHLink will expire** at some pre-specified time. Depending on the Data Sharer's software, an expiration time may be mandatory.

Regarding "what to share": a single SHLink at a specific point in time will *resolve* to a manifest of files of the following types:
* `application/smart-health-card`: a JSON file with a `.verifiableCredential` array containing SMART Health Card JWS strings, as specified by https://spec.smarthealth.cards#via-file-download.
* `application/smart-api-access`: a JSON file with a SMART Access Token Response (see [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html#response-5)). Two additional properties are defined:
  * `aud` Required string indicating the FHIR Server Base URL where this token can be used (e.g.,  ``"https://server.example.org/fhir"``)
  * `query`: Optional array of strings acting as hints to the client, indicating queries it might want to make (e.g., `["Coverage?patient=123&_tag=family-insurance"]`)
* `application/fhir+json`: a JSON file containing an arbitrary FHIR Bundle of data. Generally this format will not be tamper-proof.


At configuration time, the Data Sharer's software SHALL generate (or obtain from the Resource Server) a random key used for encrypting/decrypting the files in the manifest (see ["Decryption"](#Encrypting-and-Decrypting-Files)). 

:::info 
**:notebook:   Design Note (trust and encryption)**

*This pattern of encrypting files allows for deployment scenarios where the Resource Server is not trusted to know the information inside of the manifest's files. In such scenarios, the Data Sharer and Data Recipient can treat the Resource Server as a blind intermediary. That said: in many deployment scenarios the Resource Server will be hosted by a healthcare provider or other entity that already has access to such files. For consistency, this protocol always applies encryption.*
:::

:::info
**:notebook:   Design Note (Data Sharer "internals")**

*We do not standardize the protocol by which the Data Sharer's local software communicates with the Resource Server. These may be provided by the same vendor and use internal APIs to communicate -- or there may be no "local" software at all.*
:::

## 2. Data Sharer Generates a SHLink URI

### Establish a SHLink Manifest URL

Based the configuration from (1), the resource server generates a "manifest URL" for the new SHLink. The manifest URL:

* SHALL include at least **256 bits of entropy**
    * A suggested approach is to generate a cryptographically strong 32-byte random sequence and then base64url-encode this sequence to obtain a 43-character string that is used as a path segment. For example: `https://shl.example.org/manifests/I91rhba3VsuGXGchcnr6VHlQFKxfE28kuZ0ssbEuxno/manifest.json`
* SHALL NOT exceed **128 characters** in length

The Data Sharer's software incorporates the manifest URL into a SHLink as follows:

### Construct a SHLink Payload

The SHLink Payload is a JSON object including the following properties:

* `url`: Manifest URL for this SHLink
* `key`: Decryption key for processing files returned in the manifest. 43 characters, consisting of 32 random bytes base64urlencoded.
* `exp`: Optional. Expiration time in Epoch seconds. Hint to help the Data Recipient determine if this QR is stale.
* `flag`: Optional. String created by concatenating single-character flags in alphabetical order
  * `L` Indicates the SHLink is intended for long-term use
  * `P` Indicates the SHLink requires a Passcode to resolve
* `label`: Optional.  String no longer than 80 characters that provides a short description of the data behind the SHLink. 

The JSON Payload is then:
* Minified
* Base64urlencoded
* Prefixed with `shlink:/`
* Optionally prefixed with a viewer URL that ends with `#`

:::info

**:notebook: Design Note: Viewer URL Prefixes**

*By using viewer URLs that end in `#`, we take advantage of the browser behavior where `#` fragments are not sent to a server at the time of a request. Thus the SHLink payload will not appear in server-side logs or be available to server-side processing when a link like `https://viewer.example.org#shlink:/ey...` is opened in a browser.*
:::

The following optional step may occur sometime after a SHLink is generated:
* **Optional: Update Shared Files**. For some sharing scenarios, the Data Sharer MAY update the shared files from time to time (e.g., when new lab results arrive or new immunizations are performed). Updated versions SHALL be encrypted using the same key as the initial version. 


###### Example SHLink Generation
```js
import { encode as b64urlencode } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.82.0/encoding/base64url.ts';

const shlinkJsonPayload = {
  "url": "https://ehr.example.org/qr/Y9xwkUdtmN9wwoJoN3ffJIhX2UGvCL1JnlPVNL3kDWM/m",
  "flag": "LP",
  "key": "rxTgYlOaKJPFtcEd0qcceN8wEU4p94SqAwIWQe6uX7Q",
  "label": "Back-to-school immunizations for Oliver Brown"
}

const encodedPayload = b64urlencode(JSON.stringify(shlinkJsonPayload))
// "eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Voci5leGFtcGxlLm9yZy9xci9ZOXh3a1VkdG1OOXd3b0pvTjNmZkpJaFgyVUd2Q0wxSm5sUFZOTDNrRFdNL20iLCJmbGFnIjoiTFAiLCJrZXkiOiJyeFRnWWxPYUtKUEZ0Y0VkMHFjY2VOOHdFVTRwOTRTcUF3SVdRZTZ1WDdRIiwibGFiZWwiOiJCYWNrLXRvLXNjaG9vbCBpbW11bml6YXRpb25zIGZvciBPbGl2ZXIgQnJvd24ifQ"

const shlinkBare = `shlink:/` + encodedPayload;
// "shlink:/eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Voci5leGFtcGxlLm9yZy9xci9ZOXh3a1VkdG1OOXd3b0pvTjNmZkpJaFgyVUd2Q0wxSm5sUFZOTDNrRFdNL20iLCJmbGFnIjoiTFAiLCJrZXkiOiJyeFRnWWxPYUtKUEZ0Y0VkMHFjY2VOOHdFVTRwOTRTcUF3SVdRZTZ1WDdRIiwibGFiZWwiOiJCYWNrLXRvLXNjaG9vbCBpbW11bml6YXRpb25zIGZvciBPbGl2ZXIgQnJvd24ifQ"

const shlink = `https://viewer.example.org#` + shlinkBare
// "https://viewer.example.org#shlink:/eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Voci5leGFtcGxlLm9yZy9xci9ZOXh3a1VkdG1OOXd3b0pvTjNmZkpJaFgyVUd2Q0wxSm5sUFZOTDNrRFdNL20iLCJmbGFnIjoiTFAiLCJrZXkiOiJyeFRnWWxPYUtKUEZ0Y0VkMHFjY2VOOHdFVTRwOTRTcUF3SVdRZTZ1WDdRIiwibGFiZWwiOiJCYWNrLXRvLXNjaG9vbCBpbW11bml6YXRpb25zIGZvciBPbGl2ZXIgQnJvd24ifQ"
```

## 3. Data Sharer transmits a SHLink

The Data Sharer can convey a SHLink by any common means including e-mail, secure messaging, or other text-based communication channels. When presenting a SHLink in person, the Data Sharer can also display the link as a QR code using any standard library to create a QR image from the SHLink URI. 

When sharing a SHLink via QR code, the following recommendations apply:

* Create the QR with Error Correction Level Q
* Include the [SMART Logo](https://demo.vaxx.link/smart-logo.svg) on a white background over the center of the QR, scaled to occupy 15% of the image area


## 4. Data Recipient obtains a SHLink

The Data Recipient can process a SHLink using the following steps.

* Decode the SHLink JSON payload and `POST` to payload's `url`
    * Method: `POST`
    * Headers:
        * `content-type: application/json`
    * Body: JSON object including
        * `recipient`: Required. A string describing the recipient (e.g.,the name of an organization or person) suitable for display to the Data Sharer
        * `passcode`: Conditional. SHALL be populated with a user-supplied Passcode if the `P` flag was present in the SHLink payload
* Obtain a manifest and follow links to download files
* Decrypt and process each file

When responding to a manifest request, the Resource Server SHALL reject requests with an invalid Passcode and SHALL enforce a total lifetime count of incorrect Passcodes for a given SHLink, to prevent attackers from performing an exhaustive Passcode search. The error response for an invalid Passcode SHALL use the `401` HTTP status code and the response body SHALL be a JSON payload with

* `remainingAttempts`: number of attempts remaining before the SHL is disabled

### Limitations on Manifest `.files.location` links

The Data Sharer SHALL ensure that `.files.location` links can be dereferenced
without additional authentication, and that they are short-lived. The lifetime
of `.files.location` links SHALL NOT exceed one hour. The Data Sharer MAY create
one-time-use `.files.location` links that are consumed as soon as they are
dereferenced.

The Data Recipient SHALL treat any manifest file locations as short-lived and
potentially limited to one-time use. The Data Recipient SHALL NOT attempt to
dereference a manifest's `.files.location` link more than one hour after
requesting the manifest, and SHALL be capable of re-fetching the manifest to
obtain fresh `location` links in the event that they have expired or been
consumed.


The following optional step may occur sometime after a SHLink is shared:

### Optional: Periodically Re-fetch Updated Files 
When the original QR includes the `L` flag for long-term use, the Data Recipient
MAY re-fetch contents at any time. When re-fetching data, the Data Recipient
SHALL begin from the final redirect URL it discovered when first following the
QR Link, because the first-stage redirection may no longer be in place. To
support long-term access, the Manifest HTTP response SHOULD include an
[`Expires` header](https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/cache-control)
indicating the time when a subsequent fetch should be attempted.

---

## SHLink Manifest File Format

The SHLink Manifest File is a JSON file with a `files` array where each entry includes:

* `contentType`: One of  the following values:
    * `"application/smart-health-card"` or
    *  `"application/smart-api-access"` or 
    *  `"application/fhir+json"`
* `location` (SHALL be present if no `embedded` content is included):
URL to the file.  This URL SHALL be short-lived and intended for single use. For
example, it could be a short-lifetime signed URL to a file hosted in a cloud
storage service.
* `embedded` (SHALL be present if no `location` is included):
JSON string directly embedding the encrypted contents of the file as a compact
JSON Web Encryption string (see ["Encrypting"](#encrypting-and-decrypting-files)).
If present, the `embedded` value SHALL be up-to-date as of the time the
manifest is requested.

##### Example SHLink Manifest File

```json
{
  "files": [{
    "contentType": "application/smart-health-card",
    "location": "https://bucket.cloud.example.org/file1?sas=MFXK6jL3oL3SI_lRfi_-cEfzIs5oHs6rRWmrsCAFzvk"
  }, 
  {
    "contentType": "application/smart-health-card",
    "embedded": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIn0..8zH0NmUXGwMOqEya.xdGRpgyvE9vNoKzHlr4itKKW2vo<snipped>"
  },
  {
    "contentType": "application/fhir+json",
    "location": "https://bucket.cloud.example.org/file2?sas=T34xzj1XtqTYb2lzcgj59XCY4I6vLN3AwrTUIT9GuSc"
  }]
}
```

## Encrypting and Decrypting Files

SHLink files are always symmetrically encrypted with a SHLink-specific key. Encryption is performed using JOSE JWE compact serialization with `"alg": "dir"` and `"enc": "A256GCM"`.

##### Example Encryption

```ts
import * as jose from 'https://deno.land/x/jose@v4.7.0/index.ts'

const exampleShcFromWeb = await fetch("https://spec.smarthealth.cards/examples/example-00-e-file.smart-health-card");
const exampleShcBody = new Uint8Array(await exampleShcFromWeb.arrayBuffer());

const shlinkPayload =  {
  "key": "rxTgYlOaKJPFtcEd0qcceN8wEU4p94SqAwIWQe6uX7Q",
  // other properties omitted; not relevant for this example
};

const encrypted = await new jose
  .CompactEncrypt(new Uint8Array(exampleShcBody))
  .setProtectedHeader({
    alg: 'dir',
    enc: 'A256GCM'
  })
  .encrypt(jose.base64url.decode(shlinkPayload.key));
